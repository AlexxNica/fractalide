## Welcome

**Fractalide provides a Flow-based programming language, a build system and an approach to distribution, with the aim of making efficient microservices simple to reason about.**

Though, *simple to reason about* is not enough, we aim higher, we'd like [simplicity to be made easy](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy).

The canonical source of this project is hosted on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/fractalide/fractalide), and is the preferred place for contributions, however if you do not wish to use GitLab, feel free to make issues, on the mirror. However pull requests will only be accepted on GitLab, to make it easy to maintain.

## Features
Fractalide stands on the shoulders of giants by combining the strengths of each language into one programming model.

As we had to implement a Flow-based runtime in the Rust language we lose some of the zero-cost abstractions but gain an inherently concurrent system with `agents` that are entirely reusable. We check zero-cost abstractions because the `agents` make take advantage of zero-cost libraries, but they themselves must be run by a runtime.

## Problem 1
* Language level modules become tightly coupled with the rest of the code.

## Solution
* Fractalide comes with its own actor oriented, message passing, declarative dataflow programming language called Flowscript (Flow-based programming (FBP) to be specific). Flowscript makes the concept of data flowing through a system into be a first class citizen, thus, easily manipulated by the programmer/designer.
* Flowscript enforces well-factored, independent `agents` within a single process that have strict boundaries and standardized API.
* This standardized API is key to `agent` composition and is achieved via a coordination layer called a `subgraph`, which describes how `agents` are connected and compose together. A `subgraph`, from an interface perspective, is indistinguishable from a Rust `agent`, this, neatly, allows for layers of abstraction which fall away at runtime.
* These `agents` are black boxes which are only dependent on data and not any other `agent`.
* Fractalide [agents](https://crates.io/crates/rustfbp) are Rust macros that compile to a shared library with a C ABI.
* Our choice of actors *do not have any* methods calls, but *do have* the typical functional `input-transform-output` approach which allows us to keep things simple to reason about. In other words, you're not going to find many 100 millisecond RPC here.

## Problem 2
* It's easy to disrespect API contracts in many microservices setups.

## Solution
* The Unix Pipe concept typically requires one to parse arbitrary `stdin`, which is troublesome, unless you're using Cap'n Proto schema which conveniently hands structured data to you.
* Each `Edge` in a Fractalide `Subgraph`/`Graph` of `Nodes` is actually a Cap'n Proto schema.
* Say a Fractalide upstream `Node` `U` might use `Edge` `X` to send data to downstream `Node` `D`, each `Node` will reference exactly the same `Edge` `X` by name alone, hence guaranteeing the two `agents` use the same schema. Indeed, one cannot connect the graph if `U`'s output port and `D`'s input port aren't the same `Edge`. Say you change `Edge` `X`'s schema, `nix` will lazily recompile `Node` `U` and `D` and the type checks will fail. Thus you're sure arbitrary changes to `Edges` will cause dependent `Nodes` to fail. Allowing you to have extremely high confidence that APIs are respected. This kind of behaviour isn't exhibited in other microservice deployments where components construct arbitrary JSON data structures.
* Fractalide `agents` communicate using `Cap'n Proto`schema , which is *`a type system for distributed systems`*, and is *`infinitely faster`* than protocol buffers ([read the website](http://capnproto.org)). Even better yet, Cap'n Proto schema can be extended without breaking `agents` with a different versions. That would be a problem if we weren't in complete control of versioning in a distributed system.

## Problem 3
* Knowing what versions and dependencies is a nightmare in many microservice setups. Especially when rolling back.

## Solution
* [Nix](http://nixos.org/nix) is a declarative lazy language and will make the system reflect your system description exactly.
* [Nixops](http://nixos.org/nixops) provides the means to do code delivery, whilst ensuring the entire cluster is at the expected version.
* Due to `nix`'s declarative behaviour, each service is intelligent enough to automatically setup its own dependencies such as a silo'ed data persistence store. They may also draw from the wealth of [crates.io](https://crates.io), allowing for non-trivial `agents` to be built easily.
* You might want to start learning `nix` with these fun [quizzes](https://nixcloud.io/tour/?id=1).

## Problem 4
* Updating a single or multiple service/s in an entire cluster of nodes can be hard in many microservices setups.

## Solution
* `nixops` will only stop, update and start a service if there has been a change to it, otherwise the service will continue working as per normal.

## Problem 5
* Security and business interests rarely align these days.

## Solution
##### Security
* Fractalide's `agents` are very strict about accepting data. Strongly inspired by the [langsec work](http://langsec.org) of Meredith Patterson, Len Sassaman and Dan Kaminsky. Fractalide makes use of the [Nom](https://github.com/Geal/nom) parser combinator, implemented by Geoffroy Couprie, to parse Flowscript. Components cannot connect together unless they use the same [Cap'n Proto](https://capnproto.org/) schema, which is implemented by David Renshaw, and the brain child of Kenton Varda. Of course, [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), a high level systems language helps us prevent an entire class of buffer overflow exploits, without sacrificing speed for safety.

##### Business
* Flowscript allows for a separation of business logic and `agent` implementation logic. Thus programmers can easily own areas of code, or practise ["Sovereign Software Development"](https://top.fse.guru/the-civilized-alternative-to-agile-tribalism-4c60d01428c0), and given the [fast moving nature](https://medium.com/@bryanedds/living-in-the-age-of-software-fuckery-8859f81ca877) of business, a programmer can reuse `agents` and quickly manipulate data flowing through the system, or ideally, train the suits to manipulate the business logic themselves. Fractalide attempts to hand tools and techniques to the programmer to survive in such an environment.

### Steps towards stable release.
- [x] [Flowscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming) - a declarative dataflow language a little more suited to distributed computing.
- [x] [Fractals](fractals/README.md) - allowing you to create your own repositories outside the canonical Fractalide repository.
- [x] [HTTP support](https://github.com/fractalide/fractal_net_http).
- [ ] [Service composition](https://github.com/fractalide/fractal_workbench/blob/master/service.nix).
- [ ] Deployable example of a simple microservices setup.
- [ ] Documentation.
- [x] Remove cargo.
- [x] Stabilize `nodes`, `edges`, `subgraphs` and `agents` API.
- [x] Cap'n Proto schema composition.
- [ ] Reduce heap allocations.
- [ ] Upgrade `nom` parser combinator to 2.0.
- [ ] 1.0 Stabilization version.

### Quick start
Fractalide supports whatever platform [Nix](http://nixos.org/nix) runs on. Quite possibly your package manager already has the `nix` [package](https://hydra.nixos.org/job/nix/master/release#tabs-constituents), please check first.
For the most efficient way forward, ensure you're using [NixOS](http://nixos.org), The Purely Functional Linux Distribution.

This codebase is currently in huge flux before stabilization, but at least you can build an agent using the new [nixcrates](https://github.com/fractalide/nixcrates) approach. Should hopefully be back to normal in a few days.
